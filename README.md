# RaPid-SCOPF
Resilient and Probabilistic reliability management of the transmission grid using Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow

Setup, solution and post-prosessing of SCOPF formulations based on Power Transfer DIstribution Factors. It can take input on the Matpower-format, a csv-file or an xlsx-file. Constraints can be set manually and automatically.

## Usage
The code is under development. It is only testet and developed during my PhD on a single computer.

## Project Funding
The development of `RaPidSCOPF` has received funding from the Research Council of Norway through the project ["Resilient and Probabilistic reliability management of the transmission grid" (RaPid)](https://www.sintef.no/en/projects/2019/rapid/) (Grant No. [294754](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/294754)), The Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate, and Statnett.
